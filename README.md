# Riptide Mapping
This package will handle our mapping system, which takes data in from our 3D Vision System, DOPE, and uses it to update our model for the current position of all our objects of interest, which is then published for use in our navigation and task code systems. Expect a more extensive README once we hit a minimally viable product.
