# Initial data for objects and obstacles

objects:

  pole:
    position: [0, 0, 0] # x/y/z
    yaw: 0 # Just yaw, we don't care about the other two; units DEGREES 

    # NOTE: If you want to say you are really sure, use .000001 instead of 0 to avoid divide-by-zero errors.
    # x,y,z,yaw covariances (higher = more uncertain); units m^2
    covariance: [1.25, 1.25, .000001, .000001]
